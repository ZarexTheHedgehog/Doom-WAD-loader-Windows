# Doom WAD loader-Windows
A doom wad loader for Windows written in Batch code

How it works :

Batch file is started in the doom folder, where all the wads are. Then, it lists the folders available as IWADS. 
The IWAD will be the IWAD in which GZDoom will start up.
Next, it will change directory to the one corresponding to the IWAD selected previously, list all the WADS available for the PWAD entered previously by changing into the appropriate directory.
Then, the user will be prompted to select the PWAD to start gzdoom with and will start gzdoom with all the arguments entered previously.

Anyways, that's all for the program!
